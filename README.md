# Excelerator

A script I developed for writing my master's thesis (in LaTeX) to automatically export multiple Excel table files as PDF files.  

Note that Excel needs to be installed for this to work and this only support Windows.  

To install the required Pyhton libraries run the following in a terminal (CMD or PS):  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- To do:
Handle no excel documents
Handle pdf already open
Check consistency for different table sizes -->
